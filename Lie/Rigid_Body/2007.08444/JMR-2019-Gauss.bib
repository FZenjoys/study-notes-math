abstract = {This paper uses Gauss' principle of least constraint to derive the {\&}ldquo;natural{\&}rdquo; dynamic equations for redundant manipulators. This approach is the fastest way to the result that the operational space inertia matrix of the manipulator is the natural weighting matrix for the projection used in solving the redundancy problem. Force-controlled robots form a special case of redundant robots, such that the results can be applied straightforwardly to solve the long-standing problem of the {\&}ldquo;non-invariance{\&}rdquo; of the selection matrices in the hybrid force/position control paradigm},

@inproceedings{Redon2002,
abstract = {Most of well-known approaches for rigid body simulations are formulated in the contact-space. Due to Gauss' principle of least constraints, the frictionless dynamics problems are formulated in a motion-space. While the two formulations are mathematically equivalent, they are not computationally equivalent. The motion-space formulation is better conditioned, always sparse, needs less memory, and avoids some unnecessary computations. A preliminary experimental comparison suggests that an algorithm operating in the motion-space takes advantage of sparsity to perform increasingly better than a contact-space algorithm as the average number of contact points per object increases.},

abstract = {Walking, running or jumping are special cases of articulated motions which rely heavily on contact forces for their accomplishment. This central role of the contact forces is widely recognized now, but it is rarely connected to the structure of the dynamics of articulated motion. Indeed, this dynamics is generally considered as a complex nonlinear black-box without any specific structure, or its structure is only partly uncovered.We propose here to precise this structure and show in details how it shapes themovements that an articulated systemmight realize. Some propositions are made then to improve the design of control laws for walking, running, jumping or free-floating motions.},
