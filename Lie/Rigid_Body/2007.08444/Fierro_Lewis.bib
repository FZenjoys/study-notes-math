abstract = {A dynamical extension that makes possible the integration of a kinematic controller and a torque controller for nonholonomic mobile robots is presented. A combined kinematic/torque control law is developed using backstepping and asymptotic stability is guaranteed by Lyapunov theory. Moreover, this control algorithm can be applied to the three basic nonholonomic navigation problems: tracking a reference trajectory, path following and stabilization about a desired posture. A general structure for controlling a mobile robot results that can accommodate different control techniques ranging from a conventional computed-torque controller, when all dynamics are known, to adaptive controllers},

abstract = {A mobile robot is one of the well-known nonholonomic systems. The$\backslash$nintegration of a kinematic controller and a torque controller for the$\backslash$ndynamic model of a nonholonomic mobile robot has been presented (Fierro$\backslash$nand Lewis, 1995). In this paper, an adaptive extension of the controller$\backslash$nis proposed. If an adaptive tracking controller for the kinematic model$\backslash$nwith unknown parameters exists, an adaptive tracking controller for the$\backslash$ndynamic model with unknown parameters can be designed by using an$\backslash$nadaptive backstepping approach. A design example for a mobile robot with$\backslash$ntwo actuated wheels is provided. In this design, a new kinematic$\backslash$nadaptive controller is proposed, then a torque adaptive controller is$\backslash$nderived by using the kinematic controller},
