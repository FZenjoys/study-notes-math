abstract = {Although kinematic analysis of conventional mechanisms is a well-documented fundamental issue in mechanisms and robotics, the emerging reconfigurable mechanisms and robots pose new challenges in kinematics. One of the challenges is the reconfiguration analysis of multimode mechanisms, which refers to finding all the motion modes and the transition configurations of the multimode mechanisms. Recent advances in mathematics, especially algebraic geometry and numerical algebraic geometry, make it possible to develop an efficient method for the reconfiguration analysis of reconfigurable mechanisms and robots. This paper first presents a method for formulating a set of kinematic loop equations for mechanisms using dual quaternions. Using this approach, a set of kinematic loop equations of spatial mechanisms is composed of six polynomial equations. Then the reconfiguration analysis of a novel multimode single-degree-of-freedom (1DOF) 7R spatial mechanism is dealt with by solving the set of loop equations using tools from algebraic geometry. It is found that the 7R multimode mechanism has three motion modes, including a planar 4R mode, an orthogonal Bricard 6R mode, and a plane symmetric 6R mode. Three (or one) R (revolute) joints of the 7R multimode mechanism lose their DOF in its 4R (or 6R) motion modes. Unlike the 7R multimode mechanisms in the literature, the 7R multimode mechanism presented in this paper does not have a 7R mode in which all the seven R joints can move simultaneously.},

It is presented first for the case of pure rotations and then for general motion of the robot's links.

abstract = {This paper applies screw theory to the dynamic analysis of a rigid body in general spatial motion. Particular emphasis is placed upon the geometric interpretation of the velocity screw, the momentum screw, and the force screw which provide valuable physical insight into the dynamic behavior of the rigid body. The geometric relation between the velocity screw and the momentum screw is discussed in some detail. The paper shows that the dual angle between the two screws provides insight into the kinetics of the rigid body. The dynamic state of motion of the body is then described by a dual vector equation, referred to as the dual Euler equation. The paper shows that the geometric equivalent of the dual Euler equation is a spatial triangle which can be used as a graphical method of solution, or as a check, of the analytical formulation. The concepts introduced in this paper are illustrated by the well-known example of a thin, homogeneous, circular disk rolling without slipping on a flat horizontal surface. With the widespread use of computer graphics and computer-aided design, the geometric approach presented here will prove useful in the graphical representation of the dynamics of a rigid body. {\textcopyright} 1992 by ASME.},

Utilizing the penalty method to avoid the indeterminate form “0/0” when the local maximum of a virtual coefficient approaches zero, a set of dimensionally homogeneous transmission indices is proposed which can be employed for precisely representing the closeness to different types of singularities defined in twist space as well as for dimensional optimization.

The aim of the author is to show the power and elegance of these methods as they apply to problems in robotics."-MathSciNet},

@article{Kalaba1993,
abstract = {In this paper we develop an analytical set of equations to describe the motion of discrete dynamical systems subjected to holonomic and/or nonholonomic Pfaffian equality constraints. These equations are obtained by using Gauss's Principle to recast the problem of the constrained motion of dynamical systems in the form of a quadratic programming problem. The closed-form solution to this programming problem then explicitly yields the equations that describe the time evolution of constrained linear and nonlinear mechanical systems. The direct approach used here does not require the use of any Lagrange multipliers, and the resulting equations are expressed in terms of two different classes of generalized inverses—the first class pertinent to the constraints, the second to the dynamics of the motion. These equations can be numerically solved using any of the standard numerical techniques for solving differential equations. A closed-form analytical expression for the constraint forces required for a given mechanical system to satisfy a specific set of nonholonomic constraints is also provided. An example dealing with the position tracking control of a nonlinear system shows the power of the analytical results and provides new insights into application areas such as robotics, and the control of structural and mechanical systems.},

We show that with this representation it is relatively straightforward to extend existing attitude controllers based on quaternions to combined position and attitude controllers based on dual quaternions. We show this by developing setpoint nonlinear controllers for the position and attitude of a rigid body with and without linear and angular velocity feedback based on existing attitude-only controllers with and without angular velocity feedback. The combined position and attitude velocity-free controller exploits the passivity of the rigid body dynamics and can be used when no linear and angular velocity measurements are available.},

@book{Siciliano2009,
abstract = {The classic text on robot manipulators now covers visual control, motion planning and mobile robots too!Robotics provides the basic know-how on the foundations of robotics: modelling, planning and control. The text develops around a core of consistent and rigorous formalism with fundamental and technological material giving rise naturally and with gradually increasing difficulty to more advanced considerations.The theory of manipulator structures presented in the early part of the book encompasses:{\^{a}} the fundamentals: kinematics, statics and trajectory planning; and{\^{a}} the technology of actuators, sensors and control units.Subsequently, more advanced instruction is given in:{\^{a}} dynamics and motion control of robot manipulators;{\^{a}} mobile robots;{\^{a}} motion planning; and{\^{a}} interaction with the environment using exteroceptive sensory data (force and vision).Appendices ensure that students will have access to a consistent level of background in basic areas such as rigid-body mechanics, feedback control, and others. Problems are raised and the proper tools established to find engineering-oriented solutions rather than to focus on abstruse theoretical methodology. To impart practical skill, more than 60 examples and case studies are carefully worked out and interwoven through the text, with frequent resort to simulation. In addition, nearly 150 end-of-chapter problems are proposed, and the book is accompanied by a solutions manual (downloadable from www.springer.com/978-1-84628-641-4) containing the MATLAB{\^{A}} code for computer problems; this is available free of charge to those adopting Robotics as a textbook for courses. This text is suitable for use in senior undergraduate and graduate courses in automation and computer, electrical, electronic and mechanical engineering courses with strong robotics content.},

@article{Luh1980,
abstract = {Industrial robots are mechanical manipulators whose dynamic characteristics are highly nonlinear. To control a manipulator which carries a variable or unknown load and moves along a planned path, it is required to compute the forces and torques needed to drive all its joints accurately and frequently at an adequate sampling frequency (no less than 60 Hz for the arm considered). This paper presents a new approach of computation based on the method of Newton-Euler formulation which is independent of the type of manipulator-configuration. This method involves the successive transformation of velocities and accelerations from the base of the manipulator out to the gripper, link by link, using the relationships of moving coordinate systems. Forces are then transformed back from the gripper to the base to obtain the joint torques. Theoretically the mathematical model is “exact”. A program has been written in floating point assembly language which has an average execution time of 4.5 milliseconds on a PDP 11/45 computer for a Stanford manipulator. This allows an on-line computation within control systems with a sampling frequency no lower than 60 Hz. A further advantage of using this method is that the amount of computation increases linearly with the number of links whereas the conventional method based on Lagrangian formulation increases as the quartic of the number of links.},

However, in this paper, we review only those algorithms which have been derived based on the Euler-Lagrange, Newton-Euler and Kane's formulations of the dynamic equations of motion and are applicable to rigid-link open-chain robot manipulators. In particular, for each of these formulations we present a chronological account of the development of the most important algorithms which compute manipulator inverse dynamics. In this process some 'classical' algorithms are given and a number of issues which make it possible to reduce their computational complexity are emphasized. Also, the most efficient algorithms currently available are compared in terms of their computational complexity. {\textcopyright} 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {The position and attitude tracking of a rigid spacecraft is approached with coupled six-degrees-of-freedom dynamics described by dual quaternions. By taking advantage of the compact, nonlinear, integrated relative motion dynamics, a simple proportional-derivative (PD) controller is designed at first in the absence of modeling uncertainties. The presence of unknown mass and inertia as well as unknown constant disturbances is then taken into account. An adaptive controller is developed by combining the PD controller with an adaptive algorithm, which provides estimations of unknown parameters and disturbances. Both controllers ensure almost global asymptotic convergence of the relative pose tracking error. In addition, the proposed methods are not only computationally efficient but can also reduce the control energy consumption, since the gyroscopic terms involved in the system dynamics are preserved, rather than being cancelled by feedback. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

@article{Brodsky1994,
abstract = {The principle of transference states that when dual numbers replace real ones all laws of vector algebra, which describe the kinematics of rigid body with one point fixed, are also valid for motor algebra, which describes a free rigid body. No such direct extension exists, however, for dynamics. Rather, the inertia binor is used to obtain the dual momentum, from which the dual equations of motion are derived. This raises the dual dynamic equations to six dimensions, and in fact, does not act on the dual vector as a whole, but on its real and dual parts as two distinct real vectors. Moreover, in order to obtain the dual force as a derivative of the dual momentum in a correct order, real and dual parts have to be artificially interchanged. In this investigation the dual inertia operator, which allows direct relation of dal momentum to dual velocity, is introduced. It gives the mass a dual property which has the inverse sense of Clifford's dual unit, namely, it reduces a motor to a rotor proportional to the vector part of the former. In a way analogous to the principle of transference, the same equation of momentum and its time derivative, which holds for a linear motion, holds for both linear and angular motion of a rigid body if dual force, dual velocity, and dual inertia replace their real counterparts. It is shown that by systematic application of the dual inertia for derivation of the dual momentum and the dual energy, both Newton-Euler and Lagrange formulations of equations of motion are obtained in a complete three-dimensional dual form. As an example, these formulations are used to derive the inverse dual dynamic equations of a robot manipulator.},

abstract = {Accurate geometric and inertial parameter estimates of a modern manipulator are of crucial importance to obtain good performances during a contact task or for obtaining more and more required realistic simulations. CAD data are often provided by the manufacturer, but these are inaccurate and do not take into account eventual end-effector modifications. Fortunately, they can be identified. However, in real industrial applications, dynamic identification is rarely performed because it supposedly requires a cumbersome and long procedure. There is a need of a practical but accurate method to identify dynamics parameters. Thus, this paper proposes a practical framework to identify a Kuka LWR robot in less than 10 s. An experimental comparison between several cost functions showed that log{\{}det(⋅){\}} is the best trade-off for getting a good parameters accuracy within a minimal time. The procedure identifies very accurately the inertial parameters of the robot and of its end-effector and recognizes its geometric parameters from a look-up table. When using identified parameters, joint torques were estimated with an RMS difference lower than 1 N m when compared to measured ones. The identified model was then used to generate a contact painting trajectory. During this contact task, the external forces were estimated and controlled without the use of a force sensor. Experimentation showed that the external forces could be identified with an RMS difference lower than 3 N.},

abstract = {Mainly drawing on screw theory and linear algebra, this paper presents an approach to determining the bases of three unknown twist and wrench subspaces of lower mobility serial kinematic chains, an essential step for kinematic and dynamic modeling of both serial and parallel manipulators. By taking the reciprocal product of a wrench on a twist as a linear functional, the underlying relationships among their subspaces are reviewed by means of the dual space and dual basis. Given the basis of a twist subspace of permissions, the causes of nonuniqueness in the bases of the other three subspaces are discussed in some depth. Driven by needs from engineering design, criteria, and a procedure are proposed that enable pragmatic, consistent bases of these subspaces to be determined in a meaningful, visualizable, and effective manner. Three typical examples are given to illustrate the entire process. Then, formulas are presented for the bases of the twist/wrench subspaces of a number of commonly used serial kinematic chains, which can readily be employed for the formulation of the generalized Jacobian of a variety of lower mobility parallel manipulators.},

abstract = {Introduction to Theoretical Kinematics provides a uniform presentation of the mathematical foundations required for studying the movement of a kinematic chain that makes up robot arms, mechanical hands, walking machines, and similar mechanisms. It is a concise and readable introduction that takes a more modern approach than other kinematics texts and introduces several useful derivations that are new to the literature. The author employs a unique format, highlighting the similarity of the mathematical results for planar, spherical, and spatial cases by studying them all in each chapter rather than as separate topics. For the first time, he applies to kinematic theory two tools of modern mathematics - the theory of multivectors and the theory of Clifford algebras - that serve to clarify the seemingly arbitrary nature of the construction of screws and dual quaternions. The first two chapters formulate the matrices that represent planar, spherical, and spatial displacements and examine a continuous set of displacements which define a continuous movement of a body, introducing the "tangent operator." Chapter 3 focuses on the tangent operators of spatial motion as they are reassembled into six-dimensional vectors or screws, placing these in the modern setting of multivector algebra. Clifford algebras are used in chapter 4 to unify the construction of various hypercomplex "quaternion" numbers. Chapter 5 presents the elementary formulas that compute the degrees of freedom or mobility, of kinematic chains, and chapter 6 defines the structure equations of these chains in terms of matrix transformations. The last chapter computes the quaternion form of the structure equations for ten specific mechanisms. These equations define parameterized manifolds in the Clifford algebras, or "image spaces," associated with planar, spherical, and spatial displacements. McCarthy reveals a particularly interesting result by showing that these parameters can be mathematically manipulated to yield hyperboloids or intersections of hyperboloids.},

As the complexity of multibody system increases, the need for more elegant formulation of the equation of motion becomes an issue of paramount importance. Our primary focus is on the kinematic analysis of rigid bodies and serial manipulators (robotic systems) using simultaneously, both homogeneous transformations (4x4) matrices and Dual Quaternions, for the sake of results comparisons (cost, complexity, storage capacity etc.). This paper has been done mainly for educational and pedagogical purposes, hoping that the scientific community will finally adopt and use Dual Quaternions at least when dealing with multibody systems and specially robotics.

Quaternions over dual numbers are an established alternative representation; however, their use presents certain challenges: the dual quaternion exponential and logarithm contain a zero-angle singularity, and many common operations are less efficient using dual quaternions than with matrices. We present a new derivation of the dual quaternion exponential and logarithm that removes the singularity, we show an implicit representation of dual quaternions offers analytical and empirical efficiency advantages compared with both matrices and explicit dual quaternions, and we derive efficient dual quaternion forms of differential and inverse position kinematics. Analytically, implicit dual quaternions are more compact and require fewer arithmetic instructions for common operations, including chaining and exponentials. Empirically, we demonstrate a 30–40{\%} speedup on forward kinematics and a 300–500{\%} speedup on inverse position kinematics. This work relates dual quaternions with modern exponential coordinates and demonstrates that dual quaternions are a robust and efficient representation for robot kinematics.},

abstract = {Robotic assistance allows surgeons to perform dexterous and tremor-free procedures, but robotic aid is still underrepresented in procedures with constrained workspaces, such as deep brain neurosurgery and endonasal surgery. In those, surgeons have restricted vision to areas near the surgical tool tips, which increases the risk of unexpected collisions between the shafts of the instruments and their surroundings, in special when those parts are outside the surgical field-of-view. Dynamic active constraints can be used to prevent collisions between moving instruments and prevent damage to static or moving tissues. In this work, our vector field inequality method is extended to provide dynamic active constraints to any number of robots and moving objects sharing the same workspace. The method is evaluated in experiments and simulations in which the robot tools have to avoid collisions, autonomously and in real-time, with a constrained endonasal surgical environment and between each other. Results show that both manipulator-manipulator and manipulator-boundary collisions can be effectively prevented using the vector field inequalities.},

abstract = {This work uses vector field inequalities (VFI) to prevent robot self-collisions and collisions with the workspace. Differently from previous approaches, the method is suitable for both velocity and torque-actuated robots. We propose a new distance function and its corresponding Jacobian in order to generate a VFI to limit the angle between two Pl$\backslash$"ucker lines. This new VFI is used to prevent both undesired end-effector orientations and violation of joints limits. The proposed method is evaluated in a realistic simulation and on a real humanoid robot, showing that all constraints are respected while the robot performs a manipulation task.},

abstract = {This paper presents a solution based on dual quaternion algebra to the general problem of pose (i.e., position and orientation) consensus for systems composed of multiple rigid-bodies. The dual quaternion algebra is used to model the agents' poses and also in the distributed control laws, making the proposed technique easily applicable to formation control of general robotic systems. The proposed pose consensus protocol has guaranteed convergence when the interaction among the agents is represented by directed graphs with directed spanning trees, which is a more general result when compared to the literature on formation control. In order to illustrate the proposed pose consensus protocol and its extension to the problem of formation control, we present a numerical simulation with a large number of free-flying agents and also an application of cooperative manipulation by using real mobile manipulators.},

abstract = {This work addresses the task-space design prob- lem of a linear-quadratic optimal tracking controller for robotic manipulators using the unit dual quaternion formalism. The efficiency, compactness, and lack of singularity of the representation render the unit dual quaternion a suitable framework for simultaneously describing the attitude and the position of the end-effector. Motivated by the advantages of this kinematic description, we propose a new task-space linear- quadratic optimal tracking controller in order to find an optimal trajectory for the end-effector, providing a tool to balance more conveniently the end-effector error and its task- space velocity. This is possible because the kinematic control problem using the dual quaternion transformation invariant error can be reduced to an affine time-varying system. The proposed optimal tracking controller allows the compensation of trajectory induced disturbances, as well as other modeled additive disturbances and known bias. Simulation results with different design parameters provide a performance overview, in comparison with standard kinematic controllers with and without a feed-forward term, for tracking a desired reference.},

@article{Adorno2015,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach for the description of physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) tasks that involve two-arm coordination, and where tasks are described by the relative pose between the human hand and the robot hand. We develop a unified kinematic model that takes into account the human-robot system from a holistic point of view, and we also propose a kinematic control strategy for pHRI that comprises different levels of shared autonomy. Since the kinematic model takes into account the complete human-robot interaction system and the kinematic control law is closed loop at the interaction level, the kinematic constraints of the task are enforced during its execution. Experiments are performed in order to validate the proposed approach, including a particular case where the robot controls the human arm by means of functional electrical stimulation (FES), which may potentially provide useful solutions for the interaction between assistant robots and impaired individuals (e.g., quadriplegics and hemiplegics).},

abstract = {This paper introduces the Manipulation Task Model (MTM), an algebraic approach to describe manipulation tasks for robotic systems. The model is based on dual quaternion algebra to describe poses, linear and angular velocities, and forces and moments, all of which are joined to form the algebraic group of actions. We then use this group together with process algebra to describe temporal and logical relations between actions composing manipulation tasks. A simulation example of a cleaner robot shows that the proposed model is comprehensive and expressive enough, and that it provides robustness in relation to perturbations at the task level. Future developments will include merging the model with underlying controllers in order to provide a unified means for description, planning, and execution of manipulation tasks for robotic systems.},

@article{Ferrari2010,
abstract = {Different 3D motion analysis protocols are currently available, but little is known regarding the level of similarity of their outcomes, e.g. whether a joint-angle waveform from one protocol can be interchanged with that measured by another protocol. Similarity assessments are therefore urgent to ease the comparison of results. In this context, a major issue is how to quantify the similarity between waveforms measured synchronously through different protocols, within each of many movement-cycles (e.g. gait-cycle), when the effect of protocols on waveforms similarity is the only of interest. For this purpose we developed a new formulation of the statistical index called coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC). The CMC measures the overall similarity of waveforms taking into account the concurrent effects of differences in offset, correlation, and gain. The within-day CMC originally proposed by Kadaba et al. [7], was firstly reinterpreted in terms of " excluded factors" Then, the new formulation was set to assess the inter-protocol similarity, removing the between-gait-cycle variability. An example showing the effectiveness of the new formulation is presented regarding the pelvis-trunk and ankle kinematics. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},
