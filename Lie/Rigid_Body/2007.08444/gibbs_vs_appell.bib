@article{Mathematical1992,
abstract = {The method for the development of the equations of motion for systems of constrained particles and rigid bodies, developed by T. R. Kane and called Kane's Equations, is discussed from a geometric viewpoint. It is shown that what Kane calls partial velocities and partial angular velocities may be interpreted as components of tangent vectors to the system's configuration manifold. The geometric picture, when attached to Kane's formalism shows that Kane's Equations are projections of the Newton-Euler equations of motion onto a spanning set of the configuration manifold's tangent space. One advantage of Kane's method, is that both non-holonomic and non-conservative systems are easily included in the same formalism. This easily follows from the geometry. It is also shown that by transformation to an orthogonal spanning set, the equations can be diagonalized in terms of what Kane calls the generalized speeds. A further advantage of the geometric picture lies in the treatment of constraint forces which can be expanded in terms of a spanning set for the orthogonal complement of the configuration tangent space. In all these developments, explicit use is made of a concrete realization of the multidimensional vectors which are called K -vectors for a K -component system. It is argued that the current presentation also provides a clear tutorial route to Kane's method for those schooled in classical analytical mechanics.},

@article{Mata2002,
abstract = {In this paper, two algorithms for solving the Inverse Dynamic Problem based on the Gibbs-Appell equations are proposed and verified. Both are developed using mainly vectorial variables, and the equations are expressed in a recursive form. The first algorithm has a computational complexity of O(n2) and is the least efficient of the two; the second algorithm has a computational complexity of O(n). This algorithm will be compared with one based on Newton-Euler equations of motion, formulated in a similar way, and using mainly vectors in its recursive formulation. The O(n) proposed algorithm will be used to solve the Inverse Dynamic Problem in a PUMA industrial robot.},
