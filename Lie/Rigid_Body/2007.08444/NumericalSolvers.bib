@article{Fraisse2015a,
abstract = {When a robot is highly redundant in comparison to the task to be executed, current control techniques are not " economic " in the sense that they demand, most of the time unnecessarily, all the joints to move. Such behavior can be undesirable for some applications. In this direction, this work proposes a new control paradigm based on linear programming that intrinsically provides a parsimonious control strategy, that is, one in which few joints move. In addition to a formal stability proof, the paper presents simulation and experimental results on the HOAP-3 humanoid robot. Finally, a comparison is made with a least-square method based on the pseudoinverse of the task Jacobian, showing that the proposed method indeed uses fewer joints than the classic one.},
