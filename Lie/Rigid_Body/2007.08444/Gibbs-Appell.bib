@article{Penrose1955,
abstract = {This paper describes a generalization of the inverse of a non-singular matrix, as the unique solution of a certain set of equations. This generalized inverse exists for any (possibly rectangular) matrix whatsoever with complex elements. It is used here for solving linear matrix equations, and among other applications for finding an expression for the principal idempotent elements of a matrix. Also a new type of spectral decomposition is given.},

@article{Lewis1996,
abstract = {We present a generalisation of the Gibbs-Appell equations which is valid for general Lagrangians. The general form of the Gibbs-Appell equations is shown to be valid in the case when constraints and external forces are present. In the case when the Lagrangian is the kinetic energy with respect to a Riemannian metric, the Gibbs function is shown to be related to the kinetic energy on the tangent bundle of the configuration manifold with respect to the Sasaki metric. We also make a connection with the Gibbs-Appell equations and Gauss' principle of least constraint in the general case.},
